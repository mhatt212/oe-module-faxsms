# module-faxsms
Fax and SMS feature for OpenEMR

Twilio has dropped support for the Fax Api so currently this modules fax feature is only supported using the Ring Central vendor.
We are seeking sponsors to add the Documo vendor or another repacement vendore. Twilios SMS still works well if massaging is all you need.
